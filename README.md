# Behaviors
Flocking: Assets/Scripts/Flocker.cs  
 
# Comments:
1. This program has a set of 13 obstacles in a 'flock' which seek the player while avoiding collisions and staying together as a cohesive unit.
2. Extensibility can be improved (currently each 'flocker' must be added into the others' arrays manually, which is frankly terrible)  
3. Balancing of the weights can be improved, for separation currently requires a disproportionately large weight to be noiceable. 
4. Adding obstacle avoidance to the blend of behaviors would be an interesting future addition.
